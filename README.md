# ROS workshop (11.12.2016)

## What is ROS and why do we need it?

## Installation

ROS is native Linux, so you need to have one, to use it. Just for evaluation, you can use virtual machine with Linux (preferably from Ubuntu family). For now, there is no realiable Windows support.

### xBuntu systems (Linux hosts)

Sice ROS can be installed with _apt_ tool, it is pretty simple, to handle installation process. 
The process itself is described [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu), and consists of two steps:
1. Add ROS to sources lists.
2. Install packages.

For desktop installation, it is a good choice to install package desktop-full (_ros-kinetic-desktop-full_) and not to bother if any of major packages is installed or not.

### Virtual Machine

For sake of simplicity, we are using virtual machines during workshop: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. This setup is absolutely fine for us.
